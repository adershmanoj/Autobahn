                        It was 3 years back when we started off this journey.We propelled <strong>Triva Yanthram</strong>, we imparted vigour to its powerhouse. The Motörheads of SCT redefined the complexion of an Auto-fest, a first of its kind in Kerala. They termed this venture by the name of the German Wonderland, the <strong>Autobahn</strong>, were dreams come true for any car enthusiast. Yes, so did our seniors, to enliven the vision of <strong>Autobahn 2013</strong> and <strong>Autobahn 2014</strong>. They launched themselves <strong>‘Gearing to Shift’</strong> , later <strong>‘Shifting to Overdrive’</strong>. Its time we pull the trigger for the 2017 edition with all your support and backing.

                        The fame spreaded territories faster than light to conquer hearts of many aspiring students, which was a driving force in making them travel thousands of kilometers to be a part of this spectacle earthen than just read about them in literals. MOTORSHOW '05 showed us to never set a limit to what we can achieve. The show always provided the crowd with nothing less than the best including talk shows and seminars of some of the pinnacle automotive leaders, now crossing boundaries of our nation.

                        The German freeway, the dream of every automobile enthusiast worth his salt, a road with no limits, it's name meant speed and the only thing that came close happened to be our fest. And so, it happened- AUTOBAHN '07. A fest revamped, entirely in it's aesthetics and functionality. Doubts flew off the walls when the sincere fan base, of AAES's fame and pride, whole heartedly accepted the latest edition of the fest that saw the most modern methodologies in conducting an outstanding expo, paper presentations and seminars. The fest also staged a full fledged cultural fest with a crowd turn-up seen never before, hinting that the best days are yet to come.

                        The success in the year 2007, only inspired the students and AAES to set new records and climb higher to the peak of satisfaction. All the inspiration and history drove the minds to bring together one if the best festivals ever organized by a student body all over the nation. AUTOBAHN '13, staged the best from the automotive universe with programs like auto-expo, obstacle race, dirt racing, auto-modding competitions, Gokarting, technical expo, parking challenge and a never seen before death defying stunt show by GhostRyderZ. A perfect matchup that had no equal for anytime to come.

                        The previous year's Autobahn was now the benchmark for colleges around the nation, making every automobile enthusiast to better his skills for the better repeatedly, since the expertise of the self-proclaimed fest made it too good to catch-up. Thus bigger, got better, with AUTOBAHN '14, which yet again spread waves around the public and changed notions to nothing close to a mediocre expo. The year saw a fest most widely publicized with programs like auto-expo, Apex racing workshops, Gokarting, auto-quiz, pitstop and out of the blue, a show by the true champion, the Polish Prodigy, Rafal Pasierbek a.k.a Stunter13. Thus only AUTOBAHN could leave a crowd both speechless and make them scream with awe.

                        Now, it's the start of a new year. An year promised to witness the greatest and most anticipated auto-fest of our people. This time, it's not about technical prowess, it's not about fame, it's simply about reaching to the depths of every Motörhead's soul and sending a message. A message that, it ain't the white collars that keeps our head high, but our greasy hands.<br>We are a team of individuals or rather a family of high spirited pioneers in the making, who wouldn't stand for anything other than total victory and anything less than that is failure. Burnt rubber, chequered flags, flaming turbos..you're in the land of the Relentless. This is AUTOBAHN.

                       The highlight of autobahn has always been it's autoexpo.Infact the first ever auto expo in the state of Kerala was organised by the AAES of SCTCE under the name Motorshow which was later re-christened to AUTOBAHN.From luxury vehicles worth crores to out of the world modifications,Autobahn has featured it all.Autobahn has pioneeredd perfection when it comes to its autoexpo and has grabbed headline time and again for being the best autoexpo in the state.Autobahn has drawn attention for its sprawling dome,flawless arrangements,automobiles on display and huge crowd attending the expo.The execution of the expo has been exponentially well managed in the past with a record of 100% satisfaction on part of many participants and viewers,regarding the condition of the vehicles.In fact Tata Motors chose autobahn to launch the fanes Tata Indica for the first time in Kerala.The success of that launch is evident from the fact that Tata motors chose the same venue a decade later to launch the last version of Indica, the Indica D90.

                       With every leap forward in technology comes a unique new set of concerns. Electric cars may offer a greener and quieter alternative, but the worry of range anxiety - the fear of your car running out of power and leaving you stranded - has become a barrier to the wider spread of the technology.

                    By 2030, 70% of the world’s population will be living in cities and urban areas - they won’t all be able to hit the road at the same time. Cities will have to change to allow everyone to move freely and easily as populations boom. <span>Charging points for electric cars will need to become commonplace</span>, whilst investment in public transport and travel infrastructure will also need to increase, to accommodate more journeys and even self-driving cars. How long will this transformation take? Tesla founder Elon Musk believes it will take twenty years for driverless cars to become the norm - by which time, our towns and cities must be ready for change.

Ford want to encourage the use of smartphone apps and smart watches to find parking spaces and coordinate fuel-saving rideshare opportunities. <span>Apps such as CarPlay and Android Auto will allow wireless interaction between your car and your phone</span>, and are predicted to become widely popular, as in-car technology becomes increasingly advanced. Other exciting advances, such as biometric entry technology and active health monitoring, may be a little further down the road.
